1. sorry i did not saw there was a private repo for server site
2. i used render instead of vercel. i deployed the code into vercel but after some times it was crashing . after crash i could not fixed that so thats why i used render.
3. HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER MY MISTAKE (GIVING PERSONAL SERVER REPO INSTEAD OF PROGRAMMING HEROS PRIVATE REPO) AND DEPLOYING IN RENDER INSTEAD OF VERCEL
